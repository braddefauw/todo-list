- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list

- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- create different projects/separate lists of todos
- choose which project their todos go to
- add todos to default project
- add persistence to the app using Web Storage API

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS
- Modules
- Webpack


### What I learned

This project was a great recap of everything I've learned recently, from key CSS principles, to HTML forms and webpack, modules and classes in JS and persistence with local storage. This was for sure a big challenge - state management with vanilla JS is not simple! Definitely looking forward to diving into state management with React after this project.


### Continued development

As previously mentioned, I'm very interested in learning state management with react after completing this project. I also think that I could benefit from cleaner code in the future and am looking forward to reading up on some best practices for clean code.

### Useful resources

- [Looping Through Query Selector All](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/loop-queryselectorall-matches/) - This helped me when I was looping through query selector all, versus a simple query selector. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
- [Looping Through an Array](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3010840/loop-through-an-array-in-javascript) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand looping through an array. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
